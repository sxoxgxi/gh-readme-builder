# Realtime Spotify Github Profile 
This is a Python script that allows you to automatically update your Github profile README with your latest Spotify activity. The script uses the Spotipy library to access your Spotify data, and then generates a new README file with the current song you're listening to, your top artists, and your top tracks. This new README file can then be committed and pushed to your Github profile, allowing anyone who visits your profile to see your latest musical interests.
